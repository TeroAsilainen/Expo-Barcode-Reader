# Expo-Barcode-Reader

In this exercise for Oulu University of Applied Sciences
Web & Hybrid Technologies in Mobile Programming course, I did a Barcode Scanner in React Native with Expo-Camera library.

I chose to close the camera once a barcode is read, so that Scan Again button will actually work. Otherwise the camera will keep reading new barcodes.
